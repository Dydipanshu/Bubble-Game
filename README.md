# Bubble Pop Game

This is a simple web-based bubble-popping game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can click on bubbles by clicking on them, and the goal is to score as many points as possible within a set time limit.

## How to Play

1. Click on the bubbles that have the same number as hit.
2. Each clicked bubble adds 10 points to your score.
3. Try to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.

## Gameplay

- The timer starts at 60 seconds.
- Clicking a bubble increments your score.
- The game ends when the timer reaches zero.
- You can start a new game by clicking the "Play Again" button after the game ends.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
